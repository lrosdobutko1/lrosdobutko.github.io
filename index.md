### Enjoy the ride, because it's going to get bumpy! 

#### I lied. It's already bumpy, and it's only going to get worse from here. It's bumps all the way down!

"No fine work can be done without concentration and self-sacrifice and toil and doubt." So sayeth the great philosopher Max Beerbohm. Or so I am told. You will find no shortage of doubt and toil here as I, a former tradesperson who had had enough of the trades and chose to receive an education in software development, dive into the quagmire (Giggity) of Indy game development.  
So why a blog? Because learning is hard, and as the smoothest of smooth-brains, I learn best by repeatedly doing a thing, then thinking about that thing, and then writing down words about what I thought about that thing in the hopes that maybe the thing will stick and I can call that "knowledge".  
Also, if I have to suffer through the growing pains of being a "junior" again, I find it just a little bit more bearable if I can make as many other people suffer as I can. I'm not *just* a masochist.
