## A new developer blog?  
It's more likely than you think ...  
My name is Lawrence.  
I'm a recent graduate from college with a fancy diploma, and allegedly a specialization in software development.  
It was either that, or hang myself with an ethernet cable, because after several courses involving networking, I still don't understand what an SSL socket is.  
My intention, going forward, is to catalog my journey of learning to be a better software developer, and to document the *many* painful mistakes I will make as I go, and hopefully make it interesting to read along the way.  

I have no idea where this journey will take me, nor what I will do during each leg of the journey, but I will do my best to explain each new problem I encounter, and how I go about solving them.  
With any luck, hopefully someone later on will avoid making any of the mistakes I made, because they once read an obscure blog by a former welder who just wanted to work in an industry where
the people don't completely suck the life out of you. 

This will not be a terribly insightful blog.  
You will not learn what it takes to balance on the cutting edge of technology.  
In fact, I will frequently trip over the cutting edge, and probably knock all of the good china off of the tables surrounding me.  
Don't ask why I'm surrounded by tables covered in good china. It's a whole thing ...  
But if you have any interest in watching someone fail repeatedly until there's literally no possible way to fail again (and then manage to find one more) before succeeding, then stick around.  
It might be entertaining, and I could use the company.  
The cats are getting sick of listening to all of my jokes, and I need a new audience.
